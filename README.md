### What is a Sync?

A Sync in the terms of CalSync is a job that will copy events from one calendar into another, maintaining all event details including:

- Event title
- Start and end times
- Location
- Notes
- URLs
- Alarms
- Recurrence rules
- All-day event status
- Availability status

A Sync will have the following properties:

- Which calendar to pull events from
- Which calendar to push events to
- What horizon do you want to copy events for (in days) e.g. 7 would sync the next 7 days (including the whole of today)

**Note a Sync is only one-way** if you want to sync two ways you will need two syncs (you can just add another by running `CalSync add` again)

You can set up a Sync between any two calendars that have been added to your Apple Calendar app. When you run the `CalSync add` command it will list your available calendars and ask you which one you want to pull from and push to.

### Run

`CalSync run` will run all configured syncs, if you've just installed CalSync you won't have any so you'll need to configure some using `CalSync add`

### List

`CalSync list` will list any configured syncs, including the `"id"` that you'll need if you want to remove a sync later

### Add

`CalSync add` will walk you through adding a Sync

### Remove

`CalSync remove <id>` will remove a configured Sync e.g. `CalSync remove 3E2A80DA-2EF9-4A19-92ED-174A7DCABB3D`

## Scheduling the Sync

1. Download the `com.tpreece101.calsync.plist` file
2. Open a terminal and move the file with `mv com.tpreece101.calsync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
3. Load it as a launch agent using `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tpreece101.calsync.plist`
4. Start the launch agent with `launchctl start com.tpreece101.calsync.plist`

This will run the `CalSync run` command every 15 minutes in the background with any logs going to `/tmp/CalSync_output.log`

## Sync Behavior

`CalSync run` reconciles the push calendar against the pull calendar rather
than deleting and recreating every synced event on each run: events are
matched across runs by title + start/end time (embedded in the synced
event's notes) and only created, updated, or removed when they actually
differ from the source. A run where nothing changed touches nothing. See
[`docs/things-hang-investigation-2026-08.md`](docs/things-hang-investigation-2026-08.md)
for the investigation that led to this, including why the previous
delete-all/recreate-all approach was a problem.
